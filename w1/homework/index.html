            My name is Jay Validzic. I am from Cumberland, Rhode Island and I'm a commuter student. I live with my dad, my younger brother, and my dog Buddy. My hobbies consist mainly of thrifting, cooking, baking, and gaming. I like to collect little trinkets from blind boxes and from the thrift stores, mainly collecting Sanrio, Marvel, Monster High, and Hirono.

                In my free time, I often times like to watch <a href="https://explore.org/">Explore.org</a> live webcams. I love watching how the animals interact in their enviornment, allowing me to understand how they live their lives. My personal favorite to watch is the Cape Fear webcam with the sharks, but that's because they're my favorite animal.

                My favorite series to collect is definetly <a href="https://www.sanrio.com/">Sanrio</a>. A lot of you probably know about a lot of the Sanrio crew (Hello Kitty, Pompompurin, My Melody, etc.) especially with their gaining attraction over the past few years. Fun fact, Hello Kitty was created in 1974 and her real name is Kitty White! However, my personal favorite characters are the Lloromannic crew - Berry and Cherry.

                My favorite game is <a href="https://www.identityvgame.com/">Identity V</a>. It was created by the company NeTease in 2018 with the help of Behaviour Interactive - the creators of Dead by Daylight. The reason I prefer this game to Dead by Daylight is due to the doll-like appearance of the survivors, the constant cosmetic collaberations/new cosmetics releasing often, and the storyline beind the manor/the characters. The best part, in my opnion, is that every character (both survivor and hunter) has unique mechanics that only apply to that individual character.
